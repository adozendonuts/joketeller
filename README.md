# joketeller

This was an exercise in creating Java and Android libraries. jokeprovider contains a method that spits out a random joke from a String array. jokesbackend is the API endpoint model, which is deployed to Google App Engine. jokedisplayer contains the Android activity. Dependencies for the free and paid versions are managed via Gradle.
